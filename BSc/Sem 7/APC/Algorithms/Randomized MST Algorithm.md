## Problem

[[Minimum Spanning Tree Problem]]

## Algorithm

1. Perform three iterations of [[Boruvka's Algorithm]], producing $G = (V, E)$
2. In $G':
	1. Partition edges with $p=0.5$, producing $G'=(V, E'),\ G''=(V, E'')$. Recurse on $G'$, producing [[Minimum Spanning Forest|MSF]] $F$.
	2. Use [[Find T-heavy edges Problem|FindHeavy]] to find [[T-heavy]] edges among edges in $G''$
	4. Compute MSF generated by including these edges in $F$, producing $F'$
3. Recurse on $F'$

## Proofs

Correctness: Only delete edges during Boruvka's, only add edges if they are not T-heavy (MST $\Leftrightarrow$ edges not T-heavy).

Runtime: Non-T-heavy edges are bounded by $n/8$. 

## Complexity

Time: In expectation $O(n + m)$
Space:

## Approach Explanation

- Boruvka: Reduce $\beta$ in recursive runtime calculation by reducing the number of vertices first
- Halve the problem size by recursing on half the edges
- Add small number of non-T-heavy edges at each level
