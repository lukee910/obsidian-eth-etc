## Theorem 1.5

Let $a \geq 1,\ \alpha = 1/\sqrt{2}$. Let $C$ be suitable constant. The randomized algorithm consisting of $N = C \cdot a \cdot \log^2 n$ repetitions of [[APC Randomized Min Cut Algorithm]] has a running time $O(n^2 \log^3 n) = O(n^2 \log n)$ and for each $n$-vertex input graph it computes the minimum cut size correctly with probability at least $1 - \frac{1}{n}$.
