Angle spanned by connecting the current point to two other points.

Definition: In geometry, an angle subtended (from Latin for "stretched under") by a line segment at an arbitrary vertex is formed by the two rays between the vertex and each endpoint of the segment. For example, a side of a triangle subtends the opposite angle.
