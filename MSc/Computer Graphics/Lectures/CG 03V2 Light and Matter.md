### Intro
(Intro: Wave Theory vs Corpuscular Theory)
### Blackbody
[[Blackbody]]
### Light Emission
[[Types of Light Emission]]
### Radiometry
#TODO: Assume light consists of photons with:
TODO etc. slide 54

#TODO:
#### Basic quantities
[[Radiometric Quantities]]
#### Irradiance vs Radiance
#TODO: Integration on slide 69
## Material

### BRDF vs BTDF, reflection vs refraction
#TODO: Slide 88
### Example BRDFs, BTDFs
#TODO: Slide 90 onwards
Ideal reflection and diffusion
### Fresnel Equations
#TODO 
Involves polarization, via Maxwell equations

See how much is reflected and how much is refracted.
