## Light Sources in the Real World
Complex shapes, covered with transparent materials, only a small part emits light.

Common hack: Sphere light source, put glass in front, but make that glass transparent to shadow ray checks.
### Robustness
Rendering methods are differently robust to fancy light shenanigans.

Some examples on slides 105-109.
Improve the robustness of [[Photon Mapping]] with [[Progressive Photon Mapping]].
