## Composition
Composition creates a story within the image.

How to guide the viewer's gaze? How to create points of interest?
### Composition Guides
#### Empty Space
Attention goes first to subject, then to empty space.

E.g. adding empty space behind the subject is used in horror movies.
#### Camera Angle
- Low
	- Subjects appear better, more important, more heroic, ...
- Neutral / eye-level
- High
	- Makes subjects look more small:
		- More fragile, weak
		- More innocent, cute
- Dutch angle
	- Tilted camera
	- More dynamic
		- Positive: Playful, ...
		- Negative: Something is shifted, imbalance of power, ...
#### Rule of Third
Help with:
- How much space do they take in the image?
- How important are they?
#### Visual Flow
Lines that appear from the subject to guide the gaze.

For:
- Dramatic Flair
- Intention
- Make sure viewers see the important aspects even if they only see it for a very short time
#### Tangent
Places where objects intersect at the border.
Can create ambiguity. Better to remove overall.
#### Silhouette
Help identify fast.
## Lighting
Keep in mind, realism is not the end-all, sometimes you just need to see things.
### Three points light scenario
Often used when subject is the core focus.
- Main light
	- Strong
	- Warm
	- Front, but at an angle
		- Creates shadow that reveal the volume of the face
- Fill light
	- Weaker
	- Complementary to first light
	- Fills the shadow so we can still see the subject
- Rim light
	- Contrasting color
	- Fill the silhouette, creates a rim on the off-main-light side
### Exposure
Can use histogram to see values, probably good if the values are in the middle of the RGB range.
### Contrast
- Low-key
	- Lots of contrast, strong shadows
	- Serious, dramatic, moody
- Mid-key
	- Neutral
- High-key
	- Very well lit but not overexposed
		- I.e. blacks are still black, ...
	- Safe, open, honest
### Light Falloff
Speed at which the light decays. Can play with this in digital art.

Fast falloff, so the shadow is very soft. More fantasy-like, is not that possible in real life.
## Color Theory
### Color schemes
- Analogous
	- Nearby colors
	- Little contrast
		- Not that exciting, more calm, ...
- Complementary
	- Opposite colors
- Split-complementary
	- Complementary, but include the analogous colours of (one of) the complements. Maybe not even include that complement itself, just the analogous ones.
	- High contrast
	- Very varied, lively
- Other variations exist
	- For example the plant in Wall-E vs the gray-blue background
### Realism
Don't think too much about the realism, think about the emotion you want to convey. Can override their "local color"/material color by overpowering it with colored light.

## On Busy Images
Make sure there's enough breathing space around the main subject (i.e. things without a lot of detail). Can also be achieved with blurring etc., not just with model changes.
