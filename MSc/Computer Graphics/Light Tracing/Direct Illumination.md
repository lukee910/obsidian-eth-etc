[[Rendering Equation]] term $L_{i}$: Light is directly reflected from an emitter:
$$
L_{i}(x, \vec{\omega}) = L_{e}(r(x, \vec{\omega}), -\vec{\omega})
$$
Where:
- Represents the first term of the [[Rendering Equation]] ($L_{e}$) at the next bounce (vs [[Indirect Illumination]])
- $r(x, \vec{\omega})$ is the closest intersection
- $\vec{\omega}$ comes from $d\vec{\omega}_{i}$ in the [[Rendering Equation]] integration
