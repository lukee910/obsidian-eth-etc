Typically defined at point $p$ with emitted [[Flux|Radiant Power]] $\Phi$. Sometimes defined with [[Radiant Intensity]] $I$. Omnidirectional emission from a single point: Represents a [[Dirac Delta]], delta function.
## $L_{r}$
[[Reflection Equation]]
$$
L_{r}(x, z) = \frac{\Phi}{4\pi} f_{R}(x, p, z) V(x, p) \frac{\cos \theta_{i}}{\|x - p\|^{2}}
$$

Derived from ![[Reflection Equation#Definition]]
With $L_{i} = L_{e}$ and the integral only having a single value at $p$ ([[Dirac Delta]]).
