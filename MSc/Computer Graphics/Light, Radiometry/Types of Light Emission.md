* [[Blackbody#Incandescence|Incandescence]]
	* Blackbody radiation
* Luminescence
	* Atomic emission
		* Have very specific wavelengths
		* E.g. Sodium Vapor Lights (old street lights) $\Rightarrow$ Can't discern colors, because the light is only at a single value of the spectrum.
	* Molecular emission
		* Similar to atomic emission
		* Due to internal vibrational degrees of freedom, emitted spectrum is a narrow band, not just a precise frequency.
		* E.g. Aurora Borealis
	* Stimulated emission
		* E.g. LASER
	* Fluorescence
		* Light hits a surface, briefly ($10^{-8}$ s) absorbed, then emitted again.
		* E.g. Neon lamps: Electricity excites mercury vapor in argon or neon gas, making UV light (invisible). Phosphor coating absorbs that, then re-emitts it in the visible spectrum.
	* Phosphorescence
		* Fluorescence, but the absorption time is longer. Exponential decay in emission after source is removed.
		* E.g. CRT, Glow-in-the-dark paint
	* Chemiluminescence
		* Light emitted from chemical reactions
	* Bioluminescence
		* Chemiluminescence from organisms
