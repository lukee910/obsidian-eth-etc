CG 11V1 Lecture by Rajesh Sharma
## Progress in Rendering
### Speed
How to make a path tracer fast:
- Parallelization
- Importance Sampling
- Instancing
- Denoising
- Acceleration Data Structures
### Realism
[[BRDF]] are core for that. E.g. OpenPBR material model, where BRDFs can be layered. DisneyBSDF is 80% there.
### Still hard to do
- Slow
	- Volumetric Scattering
	- Many Lights
	- Hair, Fur
	- Subsurface Scattering
- Conceptually Difficult
	- Art-Direction, Control
## Production Rendering
The practicalities of it.
### Phases
Pre-production vs production. Pre-production is 70% of the time.

Process / Possible Steps (may be concurrent):
- ... #TODO
- Creative Development
	- Research Trip
- Storyboarding
- Visual Development
	- Character, Clothes, Scenery etc.
- Editorial
	- Timing, Dialogue, Music
	- Dialogue
		- Animation after voice recording
		- Include actor's acting in the actual animation
- Modeling
	- Creating the 3D models for everything
- Simulation
	- Physical simulations
- Layout
	- Camera, Framing
	- Basic Animations
	- Uses simplified models
- Animation
	- Detailed motion, more detailed than framing
- Technical Animation
	- Old-school manual animation
- Effects
- Lighting
	- Light and Rendering
