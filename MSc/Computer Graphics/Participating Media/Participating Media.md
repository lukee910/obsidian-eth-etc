## Modelling Approach
Model properties statistically with coefficients instead of simulating volumetric particles.
## Types
### Homogenous
Properties are *constant* throughout the medium.
### Heterogeneous
Properties are *spatially varying*.

Defining the coefficients spatially:
- Procedural, e.g. noise function
- Simulation + volumetric discretization (e.g. voxel grid etc.)
