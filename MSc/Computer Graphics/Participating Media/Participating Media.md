## Modelling Approach
Model properties statistically with coefficients instead of simulating volumetric particles.
## Types
### Homogeneous
Properties are *constant* throughout the medium.
### Heterogeneous
Properties are *spatially varying*.

Defining the coefficients spatially:
- Procedural, e.g. noise function
- Simulation + volumetric discretization (e.g. voxel grid etc.)
## Properties
- Emission
- Absorption
- Scattering
### Property Representations
- [[Albedo]]
- [[Phase Function]]
- [[Extinction Coefficient|Extinction Coefficient ($\sigma_t$)]]
- [[Absorption Coefficient|Absorption Coefficient ($\sigma_a$)]]
- [[Scattering Coefficient|Scattering Coefficient ($\sigma_s$)]]
