## Recipe
[[_T Sampling Recipe]] Area-Preserving Sampling

1. Define the desired probability of samples in a convenient coordinate system
2. Find (another) coordinate system for a convenient parameterization of samples
3. Relate the PDFs in the two systems
	1. Compute Jacobian Determinant
4. Compute marginal and conditional 1D PDFs
5. Sample 1D PDFs using the inversion method
## Example
