## Meaning
How strongly does a random variable fluctuate from its average? I.e. its squared deviation from the mean.
## Formula
$$
\begin{align}
V[Y] &= E[(Y - E[Y])^{2}] \\
&= E[Y^{2}] - E[Y]^{2}
\end{align}
$$
## Properties
$$
\begin{align}
V[aY] &= a^{2}V[Y] \\
\end{align}
$$
If $Y_{1}, Y_{2}$ **independent**, the variance is linear:
$$
V[Y_{1} + Y_{2}] = V[Y_{1}] + V[Y_{2}]
$$
