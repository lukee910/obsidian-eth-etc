## Instructions from Feature List
Simulates non-uniform media, such as fog or smoke with varying densities.

Must support bounding volumes within a shape. MIS and spectrally varying coefficients are not required, though use of MIS outside of volumes is recommended. It should support multiple scattering.

We recommend using [NanoVDB](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openvdb/tree/master/nanovdb/nanovdb) as it is much easier to include the project. There exist [tools](https://manpages.debian.org/testing/libnanovdb-tools/nanovdb_convert.1) to convert from `.vdb `to `.nvdb ` formats.
