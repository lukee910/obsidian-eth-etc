Plenoptic images / representation.
## Plenoptic Camera
Main idea: Instead of focusing on just a single point, project onto a small set of pixels. These pixels contain the different direction information.
### Multiple Focus Depths
Quickly move the sensor back and forth and capture at different focal lengths.
### Virtual Aperture Things
- Viewpoint
	- Choose same pixel in each mini lens pixel
- Aperture size
	- Take different size subsets
