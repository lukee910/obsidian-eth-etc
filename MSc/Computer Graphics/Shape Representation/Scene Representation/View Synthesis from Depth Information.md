## Forward Mapping
Project into 3D space, project onto other camera.
Problem:
- Unobserved areas are blank, occlusions
- Discretization artefacts from perspective change
	- "cracks" in 2004 paper
In short: Non-surjective map.
## Backward Mapping
Idea: Use dense depth map.
#Unclear : How does backward mapping work.
