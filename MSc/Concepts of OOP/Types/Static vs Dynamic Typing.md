Note: Go is only for interfaces.
## Type Checking
### Advantages of static checking
- Static safety: More errors found on compile
- Readability: Types are good documentation
- Performance: Type information enables optimizations
- Tool support
### Advantages of dynamic checking
- Expressiveness: No correct program is rejected by the type checker
- Low overhead while programming: No need to write type annotations
- Simplicity: Static type check systems can be complicated
