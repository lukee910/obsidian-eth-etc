## Setup
- Smoothly clamped, locally supported barrier function for collision penalties.
	- Continuous collision condition
- Intersection aware line search for the step newton iteration
	- Just making the energy smaller is not good enough
	- Have to do [[Continuous Collision Detection]] during each newton step.
