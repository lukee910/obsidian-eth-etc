Decompose [[Triangle-Triangle Distance]] test into 6 vertex-triangle and 9 edge-edge tests.
#TODO: What was that with the intersection forbidden sign?
## Vertex-Triangle Distance
#TODO: This
$$
d_{PT}(x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}, x_{4}) - \min_{u,v}\| (1 - u - v)x_{1} + ux_{2} + vx_{3} - x_{4} \|
$$

Can be transformed into case distinction. #TODO: Graphic slide 23

Problem: We have a gradient discontinuity at the switch between the cases.
## Edge-Edge Distance
#TODO: This
