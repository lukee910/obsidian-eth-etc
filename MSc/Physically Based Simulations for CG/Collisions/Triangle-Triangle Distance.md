Compute closest distance between triangle $T^{1} = (x^{1}_{2})$...
#TODO: Slides 11 Slide 21

## Side Detection
We always get the unsigned distance. We cannot detect which side we're on, and if we were travelling through things.
## Solving
Can use a Quadratic Programming (QP) solver.

Problem: This is expensive.
