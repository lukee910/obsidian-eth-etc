## Intro
[[_T Mass-Spring Systems]]:
- + Easy to understand
- - Limited accuracy
- - No volume preservation
[[_T Continuum Mechanics]] and FEM:
- + Accurate material modeling
- + Converge under refinement
- - More difficult to understand and implement
- - Nonlinearities can lead to convergence problems

Today: Something else in between those two. Faster than FEM, more precise than MSS.
