## Idea
Start at continuous model, take strain, stress, energy, and equilibrium conditions.

Then, discretise with Finite Elements:
* Decompose model into elements (e.g. tetrahedra)
* Formulate discrete energy (and derivatives) per element
* Minimize sum of per-element energies
## Pros & Cons
Advantages:
* Accurate material behaviour
* Convergence under refinement
