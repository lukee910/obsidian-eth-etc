How fast vector field is rotating around a given point.
$$
\nabla \times \mathbf{u} = \nabla \times (u,v,w) = \left( \frac{\partial w}{\partial y} - \frac{\partial v}{\partial z}, \frac{\partial u}{\partial z} - \frac{\partial w}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} \right)^T
$$
