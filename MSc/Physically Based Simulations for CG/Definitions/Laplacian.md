Scalar field $f$, the [[Divergence]] of the [[Gradient (Nabla)|Gradient]]:
$$
\nabla^{2} f = \nabla \cdot \nabla f = \frac{\partial^{2} f}{\partial x^{2}} + \frac{\partial^{2} f}{\partial y^{2}}+ \frac{\partial^{2} f}{\partial z^2}
$$
## Notes
- In one dimension, $\nabla^{2} = \frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial x^{2}}$
- Sum of the second partial derivatives with respect to each independent variable (in Cartesian coordinates).
- One perspective: Curvature or stress of the [[Vector Field]]. How much does the value differ from its average value taken over the surrounding points?
