A function that assigns a vector to every point in space.
## Notes
### Examples
- Fluid velocity is naturally represented as a vector field, every location in the fluid is moving somehow (or still)
	- $\mathbf{u}(x, y, z) = \left( u(x, y, z), v(x, y, z), w(x, y, z) \right)^{T}$
- Applying [[Gradient (Nabla)|$\nabla$]] to each of $u, v, w$ of a vector field yields the [[Jacobian]]
