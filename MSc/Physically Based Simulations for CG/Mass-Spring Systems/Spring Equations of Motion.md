From [[Motion from Newton's Second Law]]: $f_{i}(t) = m_{i}a_{i}(t)$

We build a system of 3 second order [[_T ODEs]] per mass point or for the whole system. 3 ODEs since we are in 3D.
## For one mass point
$$
f_{i}(t) = m_{i}\frac{d^{2} x_{i}(t)}{dt^2}
$$
## For the whole system
$$
f(t) = M\frac{d^{2} x(t)}{dt^2}
$$
Where $M \in \mathbb{R}^{3n \times 3n}$ is a diagonal mass matrix $M = diag(m_{1}, m_{1}, m_{1}, m_{2}, m_{2}, m_{2}, \ldots, m_{n}, m_{n}, m_{n})$
