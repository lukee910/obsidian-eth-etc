## Idea
What's the change in curve?
## Curvature
With:
- $\gamma(s) = (x(s), y(s), z(s))^{T}$ arc-length parameterized curve
- $t = \gamma'$ tangent, with $|t|=1$
- $n = \frac{t'}{|t'|}$ normal

Curvature:
$$
\kappa = |t'| = \gamma''^{T} n = t'^{T} n
$$
Note: We cannot use this formula for linear segments, because we divide by $|t'|=0$ there.
