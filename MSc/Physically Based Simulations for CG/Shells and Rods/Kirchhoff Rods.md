## Assumptions
- Inextensible
- Unshearable
	- e.g. squish some material to be a lopsided ellipsis
## Adapted Framed Curve
$$
\Gamma(s) = \{ \gamma(s);\ t(s), m_{1}(s), m_{2}(s) \}
$$
With:
- $\gamma$: [[#Centerline Curve]]
- $t(s) = \gamma'(s)$: Tangent, *adapted* to material frame (hence the name)
- $t(s), m_{1}(s), m_{2}(s)$: [[#Material Frame]]

## Centerline Curve
$$
\gamma(s) = (x(s), y(s), z(s))^{T}
$$
## Material Frame
$$
\{ t(s), m_{1}(s), m_{2}(s) \}
$$
With the choice for $m_{1}, m_{2}$ being somewhat arbitrary, as long as they're orthonormal.
### Bishop Natural Frame
Reference frame with 0 twist.
