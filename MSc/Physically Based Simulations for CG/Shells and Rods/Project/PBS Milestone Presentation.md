## Plan
- Discrete Rods
- Stretch Goal: Cutting Rods
## Current Status
### What Works
- Handles
- Twist, Bishop Frame
- Bending
	- ish
- Constraints
	- Inextensibility (ish)
### What Doesn't
- Constraints
	- Inextensibility
		- May be the root of many current issues
	- Handle Forces
- Coiling, Plectonemes
- Collisions
### What Won't
- Anisotropic rods
## Problems
- Constraint troubles
- Numerical stability issues
- Paper not explaining stuff
	- Gradients for homology
	- Constraint
- Debugging
	- One laptop has different behaviour in debug build
