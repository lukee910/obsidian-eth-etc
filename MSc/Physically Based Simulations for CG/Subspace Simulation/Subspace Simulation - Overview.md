## Idea
Problem: Complex models take a long time to simulate.

Solution: We don't need all these degrees of freedom. Find a low-dimensional subspace that captures desired behaviour, simulate there.

Goals:
- Faster than full model
- Cost independent of full model complexity
- Similar behaviour to full model
## Simple Variant - Linear Modal Analysis

Improvements:
- [[Subspace Simulation with Nonlinear Forces]]
- PCA Basis #TODO
- Modal Derivatives #TODO
- Machine learning: Learn the subspace
