# ETH Obsidian Vault

To use this:

1. Clone this repository
2. Download [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
3. Open the cloned folder in Obsidian

Alternatively, you can just use this as a folder of markdown files and browse this with VS Code etc. Note that links between files are the Obsidian style, i.e. if the filename is unique, it's \[\[FILENAME\]\] without any further path specified.
